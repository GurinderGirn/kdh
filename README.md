# kdh - Humber and district hospital
Project developed as a team to redesign hospital website. The hospital project is build on top of the ASP.Net MVC framework. 
At this project I acted as the full-stack developer and developed public as well as admin face of frequently asked questions 
and online donations. The main challenge was to use stripe to make donations online.

The website is concieved with a mobile first approach. 
So it would be possible to effortlessly launch it into any platform without making any changes to the main application.
